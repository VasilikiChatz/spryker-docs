## Layered Architecture

### Introduction to Layered Architecture

Layered Architecture in SCCOS ensures a clear separation between commercial offerings and sales channels. This architecture is split into four different layers:

* **Presentation Layer**: Interfaces like online stores, mobile apps, etc.
* **Business Layer**: Contains products, pricing, stock, and commercial information.
* **Communication Layer**: Connects the presentation to the business layer.
* **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage and processing.
