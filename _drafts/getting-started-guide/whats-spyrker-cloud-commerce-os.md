## Modular Architecture

The Spryker Commerce OS adopts a modular architecture, comprising over 750 different modules, with some being mandatory and others optional. This design allows you to create tailored solutions that match specific business needs.

### Advantages of modular architecture

* **Selectivity**: Utilize only the modules you need, reducing redundant code.
* **Scalability**: Grow your project with the wide selection of available modules.
* **Flexibility**: Add, delete, and test new features without hindering your live shop.
* **Atomic Release Approach**: Each module is developed and released independently, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Layered Architecture

Layered Architecture in SCCOS ensures a clear separation between commercial offerings and sales channels. This architecture is split into four different layers:

* **Presentation Layer**: Interfaces like online stores, mobile apps, etc.
* **Business Layer**: Contains products, pricing, stock, and commercial information.
* **Communication Layer**: Connects the presentation to the business layer.
* **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage and processing.

### Advantages of layered architecture

* **High Performance**: Long processes are confined to specific layers, ensuring optimal performance.
* **Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend development can occur simultaneously.
* **Growth Focus**: Efforts can concentrate on improvement rather than makeshift solutions.
* **Information Flexibility**: Easy to modify, extend, or replace essential information.

## Managed Cloud Platform

* **Focus on development**:  You concentrate on creating and refining your projects because you don't need to worry about managing environments.
* **Integrate seamlessly**: With CI/CD development workflows, you can achieve a streamlined development process.
