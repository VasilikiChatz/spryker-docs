We welcome all types of contributions, from issues to PRs. Because PRs reflect the changes and the context, we verify and ship them faster. Therefore, *PRs are the preferred method of contribution*.


## Licenses

Spryker uses our proprietary licenses and common open-source licenses. In general, you can contribute to our public repositories:

- [spryker](https://github.com/spryker)
- [spryker-shop](https://github.com/spryker-shop)

## Submit a PR

1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Add and commit your changes.
    Make sure the commit description clearly reflects the changes.
2. Create a PR.
    Make sure the PR name and description clearly reflect the context and the changes.

If we can't merge a PR due to our release process, we manually introduce the change. Once the change is released, we inform you by closing the PR.


## PR processing time

The processing time depends on the importance of the changes and the amount of work required to check and implement them. If an important change is submitted, we usually process it within a day.

If you create a PR and feel that the issue is important, [contact support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/) to speed up the process.
