This section contains a set of templates for project development, intended as flexible templates and starting point for development teams striving for high-quality software. While these guidelines offer a default ruleset, it's imperative to tailor them to meet the specific requirements and commitments of each project. Defining and following these guidelines may be necessary to fulfill project Service Level Agreements (SLAs), with each guideline explicitly outlining the responsible team. Alignment with all involved teams is essential for ensuring a functioning concept.
