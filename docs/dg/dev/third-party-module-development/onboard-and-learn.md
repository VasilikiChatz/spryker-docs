The basic rules of the module development can be found in [Architectural convention](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/dg/dev/architecture/architectural-convention.html) tagged with *module development*.

When providing different versions of a module, follow the [Semantic Versioning rules](/docs/dg/dev/architecture/module-api/semantic-versioning-major-vs.-minor-vs.-patch-release.html).
For differences between public and private APIs, see [Declaration of module APIs: Public and private](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/dg/dev/architecture/module-api/declaration-of-module-apis-public-and-private.html).
