We would recommend 4 steps how to improve usage of your module:
1. Provide complete integration guide for you module in **README.md** file.
   - You can find an example here https://docs.spryker.com/docs/pbc/all/data-exchange/202404.0/install-and-upgrade/install-the-data-exchange-api.html#configure-the-scheduler 
   - It is important to:
     - Keep guide up to date for the latest release. (After all the steps executed, the functionality should work for the end user)
     - Have **Verification** step that clearly states how to check that everything is done properly and functionality works as expected.

2. We recommend to use https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart for collaboration with module users, mention (In **README.md** file of your module) how issues can be reported.
   - If you have domain specific requirements for the details needed from customer to identify the issue, feel free to add them to the readme file.
3. If you have several Major (see https://semver.org/) releases, provide a migration guide for each of them.
    - You can find an example here: https://docs.spryker.com/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/202404.0/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/upgrade-modules/upgrade-the-categorygui-module.html
    - It is important to:
    - Have migration for each **Major** version starting from 2nd.
    - Have **Verification** step that clearly states how to check that everything is done properly and functionality works as expected.
4: Request Spryker review for you module to obtain **Verified by Spryker** badge, it will allow to promote and increase trust for you module from the end users. 
      
    - **TBD: More details coming soon.**
5. Publish module in Spryker Application Catalog
      
    - **TBD: More details coming soon.**
