This document provides guidelines for projects using the Stripe app.

## OMS configuration for the project

The complete default payment OMS configuration is available at `vendor/spryker/sales-payment/config/Zed/Oms/ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml`.

The payment flow of the default OMS involves authorizing the initial payment, which means that the amount is temporarily blocked when the payment method permits. Then, the OMS sends requests to capture, that is, transfer of the previously blocked amount from the customer's account to the store account.

The `Payment/Capture` command initiates the capture action. By default, this command is initiated when a Back office user clicks **Ship** on the *Order Overview* page.

Optionally, you can change and configure your own payment OMS based on `ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml` from the core package and change this behavior according to your business flow. See [Install the Order Management feature](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-order-management-feature.html) for more information about the OMS feature and its configuration.

To configure your payment OMS based on `ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml`, copy `ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml` with `Subprocess` folder to the project root `config/Zed/oms`. Then, change the file's name and the value of `<process name=` in the file.

This example demonstrates how to configure the order state machine transition from `ready for dispatch` to `payment capture pending`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<statemachine
    xmlns="spryker:oms-01"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="spryker:oms-01 http://static.spryker.com/oms-01.xsd"
>

    <process name="SomeProjectProcess" main="true">

        <!-- other configurations -->

        <states>

            <!-- other states -->

          <state name="payment capture pending" display="oms.state.in-progress"/>

            <!-- other states -->

        </states>

        <transitions>

            <!-- other transitions -->

            <transition happy="true">
              <source>ready for dispatch</source>
              <target>payment capture pending</target>
              <event>capture payment</event>
            </transition>

            <!-- other transitions -->

        </transitions>

        <events>

            <!-- other events -->

            <event name="capture payment" onEnter="true" command="Payment/Capture"/>

            <!-- other events -->

        </events>

    </process>

</statemachine>
```

By default, the timeout for the payment authorization action is set to 7 days. This means that if the order is in the `payment authorization pending` state, the OMS will wait for a day and then change the order state to `payment authorization failed`. Another day later, the order is automatically transitioned to the `payment authorization canceled` state. Therefore,
if you need to decrease or increase timeouts or change the states, modify the `config/Zed/oms/Subprocess/PaymentAuthorization01.xml` file according to your requirements.

For more information about ACP payment methods integration with your project OMS configuration, see [Integrate ACP payment apps with Spryker OMS configuration](/docs/dg/dev/acp/integrate-acp-payment-apps-with-spryker-oms-configuration.html).

## Checkout payment step

If you have rewritten `@CheckoutPage/views/payment/payment.twig` on the project level, do the following:

1. Make sure that a form molecule uses the following code for the payment selection choices:

```twig
{% raw %}

{% for name, choices in data.form.paymentSelection.vars.choices %}
    ...
    {% embed molecule('form') with {
        data: {
            form: data.form[data.form.paymentSelection[key].vars.name],
            ...
        }
    {% endembed %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}       
```

2. If you want to change the default payment provider or method names, do the following:
    1. Make sure the names are translated in your payment step template:

```twig
{% raw %}
{% for name, choices in data.form.paymentSelection.vars.choices %}
    ...
    <h5>{{ name | trans }}</h5>
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

    2. Add translations to your glossary data import file:

```csv
...
Stripe,Pay Online with Stripe,en_US
```
    3. Run the data import command for the glossary:

```bash
console data:import glossary
```

## Retrieving and using payment details from Stripe

For instructions on using payment details, like the payment reference, from Stripe, see [Retrieve and use payment details from third-party PSPs](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/{{page.version}}/base-shop/retrieve-and-use-payment-details-from-third-party-psps.html)

## How to Embed Stripe Payment Page to Your Site (iframe approach)
By default, the Stripe App payment flow assumes that the payment page is on another domain, so a user will be redirected to this page after order placement.
To enhance your storefront users' experience, you can embed the Stripe payment page directly into your site. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Configure Payment Module
Create or modify project-level `PaymentConfig.php` file (`Pyz\Zed\Payment\PaymentConfig`) and add the following configuration:
```php
namespace Pyz\Zed\Payment;

class PaymentConfig extends \Spryker\Zed\Payment\PaymentConfig
{
    public function getStoreFrontPaymentPage(): string
    {
        return '/payment'; //or any other URL you want to use, e.g. https://your-site.com/payment-with-stripe 
    }
}
```
In this setup, the redirect URL will be added as a query parameter `url` (the value is base64-encoded) to the URL you specified in the `getStoreFrontPaymentPage()` method.

### Step 2: Create the Stripe Payment Page
Create a new page in your project to render the Stripe payment page. Here's a minimal PHP example:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Order payment page</title>
</head>
<body>
<iframe src="<?php echo base64_decode($_GET['url']) ?>" width="100%" height="700px" style="border:0"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```

If your storefront application is built using front-end technologies (headless) and Spryker Glue API, you need to follow your framework library documentation
and create a new page to render the Stripe payment page using query parameters from the redirect URL provided in the Glue API `POST /checkout` response. 


If your storefront application is Yves-based, you need to create a new controller to render this page

1. Create a new controller in `src/Pyz/Yves/PaymentPage/Controller/PaymentController.php`:
```php

namespace Pyz\Yves\PaymentPage\Controller;

use Spryker\Yves\Kernel\Controller\AbstractController;
use Spryker\Yves\Kernel\View\View;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

class PaymentController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Yves\Kernel\View\View
     */
    public function indexAction(Request $request): View
    {
        return $this->view(
            [
                'iframeUrl' => base64_decode($request->query->getString('url', '')),
            ],
            [],
            '@PaymentPage/views/payment.twig',
        );
    }
}

```

2. Create a new template for this page in `src/Pyz/Yves/PaymentPage/Theme/default/views/payment.twig`:

```twig
{% extends template('page-layout-checkout', 'CheckoutPage') %}

{% define data = {
    iframeUrl: _view.iframeUrl,
    title: 'Order Payment' | trans,
} %}

{% block content %}
    <iframe  src="{{ data.iframeUrl }}" class="payment-iframe" style="border:0; display:block; width:100%; height:700px"></iframe>
{% endblock %}
```

3. Create a new route for this controller in `src/Pyz/Yves/PaymentPage/Plugin/Router/EmbeddedPaymentPageRouteProviderPlugin.php`:

```php
namespace Pyz\Yves\PaymentPage\Plugin\Router;

use Spryker\Yves\Router\Plugin\RouteProvider\AbstractRouteProviderPlugin;
use Spryker\Yves\Router\Route\RouteCollection;

class EmbeddedPaymentPageRouteProviderPlugin extends AbstractRouteProviderPlugin
{
    /**
     * @param \Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection $routeCollection
     *
     * @return \Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection
     */
    public function addRoutes(RouteCollection $routeCollection): RouteCollection
    {
        $route = $this->buildRoute('/payment', 'PaymentPage', 'Payment', 'indexAction');
        $routeCollection->add('payment-page', $route);

        return $routeCollection;
    }
}
```

4. Add router plugin to the `RouterDependencyProvider::getRouteProvider()` in `src/Pyz/Yves/Router/RouterDependencyProvider.php`.
