[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de) is a financial infrastructure platform that enables businesses to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities.

The Stripe integration in Spryker is part of the App Composition Platform and supports both the default Storefront Yves and Spryker GLUE APIs.

This section contains the guides related to running Stripe with Marketplace projects. For more information about Stripe, see [Stripe](/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/{{page.version}}/base-shop/third-party-integrations/stripe/stripe.html).

Once you integrate Stripe into your Marketplace, each individual merchant needs to onboard to Stripe to be able to use it. Make sure to inform your merchants about this process if you want them to use Stripe. For onboarding instructions, see [Onboard to Stripe in the Merchant Portal](/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/{{page.version}}/marketplace/stripe-third-party-integration/onboard-to-stripe-in-the-merchant-portal.html).
