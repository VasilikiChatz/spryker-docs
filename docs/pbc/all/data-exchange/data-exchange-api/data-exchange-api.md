TBD: what exactly it is, how business users can use them.

Link to developer documentation on data exchange API.

With the Dynamic Exchange API you can build, customize, and manage APIs tailored to your specific business requirements, all through a user interface.

Benefits:

- No coding required: You can create APIs through a user interface.
- Rapid API Generation: APIs are generated within minutes.
- Flexibility and customization: You can tailor your APIs to your exact needs and define the necessary parameters.
- Real-time updates: You can make changes to APIs dynamically, without any downtime.
Security and Access Control: There are robust  security measures and access controls in place.



No coding is needed to create additional API endpoints, only configuration.

Configuration can be adjusted in runtime, not requiring any code deployment.

Powerful capability for Customers/Partners, as also custom entities and attribute fields created by the Customer/Partner can be included via configuration and their API endpoints generated.

Doesnâ€™t require any manual coding to exchange data from a new or existing entity. 

Avoids having to code every time a new database entity data needs to be imported or exported, which generates delays on the data integration customer project and future change requests (in many cases every other month).

Solves a demand of an OOTB machine-to-machine data integration ready for any database schema, including new database entities implemented by the Customer.
