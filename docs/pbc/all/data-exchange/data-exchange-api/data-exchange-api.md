A robust API that facilitates real-time data transfers, ensuring data is always current across all integrated platforms.

No coding is needed to create additional API endpoints, only configuration.

Configuration can be adjusted in runtime, not requiring any code deployment.

Powerful capability for Customers/Partners, as also custom entities and attribute fields created by the Customer/Partner can be included via configuration and their API endpoints generated.

Doesnâ€™t require any manual coding to exchange data from a new or existing entity. 

Avoids having to code every time a new database entity data needs to be imported or exported, which generates delays on the data integration customer project and future change requests (in many cases every other month).

Solves a demand of an OOTB machine-to-machine data integration ready for any database schema, including new database entities implemented by the Customer.
