The Amazon QuickSight feature brings customizable and powerful business intelligence tools to the Back Office.

This feature supports data from Spryker projects and third-party systems. When you set up Amazon QuickSight, the data from your project is available by default, and you can add other data sources if needed.

In Amazon QuickSight, you are going to work with analyses and dashboards.

An analysis is a customizable visual representation of data. Using the provided tools, you can manipulate your data to extract and present the most important information. Each analysis can contain multiple data visualizations, which can be rearranged and customized.
