The Amazon QuickSight feature brings customizable and powerful business intelligence tools to the Back Office.

## Data sources and data sets

This feature supports data from Spryker projects and third-party systems. When you set up Amazon QuickSight, the data from your project is available by default, and you can add other data sources if needed.

## Analyses and dashboards
In Amazon QuickSight, you are going to work with analyses and dashboards.

An analysis is a customizable visual representation of data. Using the provided tools, you can manipulate your data to extract and present the most important information. Each analysis can contain multiple data visualizations, which can be rearranged and customized.

A dashboard is a representation of data prepared in an analysis. It serves as a published version of data analysis, which can be shared with other users.

Both analyses and dashboards are shareable so you can both share a complete dashboard or collaborate on an analysis.

## User management


When working with analytics, users can have the following roles:
* Author: can view, create, and edit assets.
* Reader: can view assets.

To give a Back Office user access to analytics, you need to assign one of these roles to them. For instructions, see [Create users]() and [Edit users]().

The analytics roles are derived from Amazon QuickSight and are separate from the [Back Office user roles](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/best-practices-manage-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
