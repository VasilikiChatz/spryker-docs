When setting up Amazon QuickSight for the first time, Back Office users get access to analytics based on the contract terms. User are assigned with roles, such as author or reader, defining their permissions when working with analytics. This document explains how you can update the list of users that have access to analytics or change their roles.

Changes to the users setup affect the price of Amazon QuickSight license.

To update analytics users, follow the steps.
1. Create a support ticket for updating analytics users on [Spryker Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com/s/).
  Provide the list of users you want to add or remove. For each new user, specify their role. You can request the roles of the existing users to be updated too.

2. Once your contract is updated, we add the requested changes to your users setup. Wait until you get a confirmation about this change.

3. In the Back Office, go to **Analytics**.
4. On the **Analytics** page, click **Synchronize Users**.
  This updates the users setup per your request.
