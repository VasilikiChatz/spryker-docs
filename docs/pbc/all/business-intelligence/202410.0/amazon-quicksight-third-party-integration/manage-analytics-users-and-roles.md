When setting up Amazon QuickSight for the first time, Back Office users get access to analytics based on the contract terms. Users are assigned with roles, such as author or reader, defining their permissions when working with analytics. This document explains how you can update the list of users with access to analytics or change their roles.

Changes to the users setup affect the price of Amazon QuickSight license.

To update analytics users, follow the steps.
1. To request additional users or updating existing ones, contact your Customer Success Manager at [the analytics contact page](https://now.spryker.com/contact-analytics). Provide the list of users you want to add or remove. For each new user, specify their role (author or reader). You can request the roles of the existing users to be updated too.

2. Once your contract is updated, we will add the requested changes to your users setup. Wait until you get a confirmation about this change.

3. In the Back Office, go to **Analytics**.
4. On the **Analytics** page, click **Synchronize Users**.
  This updates the users setup per your request.

  If you remove an author user, consider transferring ownership of this user's assets; otherwise, they will be lost. You can do it by sharing the assets with other author users.
