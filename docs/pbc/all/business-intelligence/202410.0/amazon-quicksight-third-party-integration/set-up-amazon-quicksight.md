This document describes how to set up Amazon QuickSight.

1. To request Business Intelligence powered by Amazon QuickSight, contact your Customer Success Manager at [the analytics contact page](https://now.spryker.com/contact-analytics).
  After the contract is signed, we activate Amazon QuickSight for your project.
2. [Install the Amazon QuickSight feature]().

3. Log into the Back Office with the user for which you've requested an Author analytics role.

4. In the Back Office, go to **Analytics**.

5. On the **Analytics** page, click **Synchronize Users**.
  This updates the analytics roles for the Back Office users you've requested in your contract.
6. Click **Enable Analytics**.
  This opens the **Analytics** page with a progress message displayed.

{% info_block infoBox "" %}

The user who enables analytics is assigned as an owner of all the default assets, such as data sets, analyses, and dashboards. You can transfer ownership later.

{% endinfo_block %}  


6. Wait for the estimated amount of time and refresh the page.
  This should display the analytics interface. Now, you can start working with data.
