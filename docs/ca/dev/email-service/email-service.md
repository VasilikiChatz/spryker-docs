- To send emails from an email address, verification is required. For details, see [Verify email addresses](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/verify-email-addresses.html).
- Emails are subject to quota restrictions. For details, see [Email quota restrictions](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/email-quota-restrictions.html).
