New Relic APM delivers detailed traces that track the flow of requests through your Spryker application, providing visibility into performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and errors to help optimize and troubleshoot your application in real-time.

For more information about New Relic APM, see [Improve your app performance with APM](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/).

To get access to New Relic, you need a paid New Relic subscription for your organization. The paid license can be purchased through Spryker. Contact your CSM to further explore this option!
