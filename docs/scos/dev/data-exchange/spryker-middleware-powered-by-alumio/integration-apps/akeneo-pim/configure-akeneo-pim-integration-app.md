QUESTION: SHOULD WE CREATE A SPRYKER CLIENT AS WELL? WHAT SETTINGS SHOULD BE DIFFERENT?

## Configure data mapping between Akeneo and Spryker

To import data from Akeneo PIM to your Spryker project, you need to map the data you want to import between the two systems. To map the data, you need to do the following:

- Transform Akeneo data into the Base data by defining an Akeneo to Base model transformer.
- Transform the Base data into the Spryker data by defining the Base model to Spryker transformer.


### Define the Akeneo to Base model transformer

To import data from Akeneo PIM, you need to transform it from the Akeneo model to the Base model. To transform the data like this, you need to create the Akeneo to Base model transformer. Do the following:

1. In the Spryker Middleware Powered by Alumio platform, go to **Connections->Entity transformers** and click the + sign.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the name of your entity transformer. As you are entering the name, the identifier will be populated automatically based on the name.
3. Optional: In the **Description** field, add the description of your route.
4. To activate the entity transformer, set the status to *Enabled*.
5. In *Settings*, select *Data, transform using mappers and conditions*. QUESTIONS: WHAT DOES THIS SETTING MEAN? CAN THEY SELECT OTHER SETTINGS, AND IF YES, THEN IN WHAT CASES WHAT SETTING SHOULD BE SELECTED?
6.  Click **Add data transformer** and select the Akeneo to Base transformers.  QUESTION: DO WE HAVE TO SELECT ALL THE TRANSFORMERS, OR JUST ONE? You can select multiple transformers depending on what product information you want to import. For information about the available Akeneo to Base transformers, see [Akeneo to Base data transformers](#akeneo-to-base-data-transformers).
![akeneo-create-an-entity-tansformer]

### Define the Base to Spryker model transformer

After the data has been transformed to the Base model, they need to be transformed to the Spryker model. To transform the data like this, you need to create the Base model to Spryker model transformer. Do the following:

1. In the Spryker Middleware Powered by Alumio platform, go to **Connections->Entity transformers** and click the + sign.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the name of your entity transformer. As you are entering the name, the identifier will be populated automatically based on the name.
3. Optional: In the **Description** field, add the description of your route.
4. To activate the entity transformer, set the status to *Enabled*.
5. In *Settings*, select *Data, transform using mappers and conditions*. QUESTIONS: WHAT DOES THIS SETTING MEAN? CAN THEY SELECT OTHER SETTINGS, AND IF YES, THEN IN WHAT CASES WHAT SETTING SHOULD BE SELECTED?
6.  Click **Add data transformer** and select the Base to Spryker transformers. You can select multiple transformers depending on what product information you want to import. For information about the available Akeneo to Base transformers, see [Base to Spryker data transformers](#base-to-spryker-data-transformers).
7. In the **Spryker HTTP Client** field, enter the client you created at this step: [Connect SCCOS with the Middleware Powered by Alumio platform](#1-connect-the-spryker-middleware-powered-by-alumio-with-akeneo-pim).
QUESTION: DO WE REALLY SELECT THE SAME CLIENT FOR AKENEO TO BASE AND BASE TO SPRYKER? OR CAN THE CLIENTS BE DIFFERENT?
8. In the **Store name** field, enter the store to which you want to import data from Akeneo. For example, *us_US*. 
9. Optional: In the *New From* and *New To* dates, enter the starting and ending dates of when the product should be displayed with the *New* label in your store.
10. Optional: Select the approval status of the product.
11. In the *Cache* field, select the cache. QUESION: WHAT CACHE AND IN WHICH CASES SHOULD BE SELECTED?

## 3. Configure the data integration path of the Akeneo PIM integration app.

To Configure the data integration path of the Akeneo PIM integration app., you need to do the following:
- create an incoming configuration
- create an outgoing configuration
- define the route

### Create an incoming configuration

The incoming configuation defines what data should be retrieved from Akeneo and how this should be done.
To create an incoming configuration, do the following:

1. In the Spryker Middleware Powered by Alumio platform, go to **Connections->Incoming** and click the + sign.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the Name of your configuration. As you are entering the name, the identifier will be populated automatically based on the name.

5. In the *Subscriber* field, select the *HTTP subscriber*. 
  QUESTION: What is the subscriber, what is each subscriber in the dropdown for, and how do they know which subscriber to select here?
6. In the *Request URL*, specify the URL to a specific product, or the URL to a list of products. 

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

The URL should include just the path after `akeneo.com`, as the base path to the Akeneo environment is already specified in the HTTP client you created. For example, if the actual path to a specific product you want to import from akeneo is `https://test.cloud.akeneo.com/api/rest/v1/producs/1234567890`, the path to specify in the *Request URL* field is `/api/rest/v1/producs/1234567890`. If you want to import products in batch from page `https://test.cloud.akeneo.com//api/rest/v1/products?limit=10`, the path you should specify is `/api/rest/v1/products?limit=10`.

{% endinfo_block %}

8. In *HTTP Client*, select the Akeneo client that you created at this step: [Connect the Spryker Middleware powered by Alumio with Akeneo PIM](#1-connect-the-spryker-middleware-powered-by-alumio-with-akeneo-pim).
10. Live other fields empty. In the top right click **Save and continue**. You should see the message that the incoming configuration has been created.

## Reference information: Transformers

Data transformers let you define the data you want to import from Akeneo PIM and map them accordingly to your Spryker system. There are two kinds of entity transformers: Akeneo data to Base data transformers and Base data to Spryker data transformers.

### Akeneo to Base data transformers

Akeneo to Base data transformers let you define what data you want to import from Akeneo to Spryker and transform these data to Base data. This Base data is then transformed to Spryker data.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

It can be that some fields that Product pages have are not required in the Akeneo PIM, but required in the Spryker system. For example, the *Price* information is not required in Akeneo, but it is required in Spryker. Even though you cannot really import these values if they are not provided in Akeneo, you must enter them manually in the corresponding fields of the entity transformers.

![placeholders-in-entity-transformers]

{% endinfo_block %}

By default, there are the following data transformers that you can use depening on the data you want to transform and import:

- Memo Akeneo to Base - Product - Set Base information: Transforms basic product information, such as name, description, SKU, tax.
- Memo Akeneo to Base - Product - Set Price Properties
- Memo Akeneo to Base - Product - Set Product Properties
- Memo Akeneo to Base - Product - Set Product Category
- Memo Base - Product - Set Stock
- Memo Akeneo to Base - Product - Set Product Media

#### Configuring the Memo Akeneo to Base - Product - Set Base information transformer

1. In the **Client** field, enter the Akeneo client you created at this step: [Connect SCCOS with the Middleware Powered by Alumio platform](#1-connect-the-spryker-middleware-powered-by-alumio-with-akeneo-pim).
2. In the **Locale** field, enter the locale from which you want to import data from Akeneo. For example, *us_US*. 

{% info_block infoBox "Locale in Akeneo" %}

If the locale in Akeneo is not specified, the locale you specify at this step will be assigned as a default one.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. In the SKU field, select one of the following options:
 - Identifier as SKU: The product identifier in Akeneo will be used as SKU in SCCOS
 - Value as SKU: You can specify the value of another filed in Akeneo which should be used as SKU in SCCOS. Specify the value in the *SKU Identifier* field that appears as the very last field
 ![value-as-sku]
4. In the *Name* field, either enter the name for your products or if you want to import it from Akeneo, use the `&{values.name}` as a placeholder.
4. In the *Description* field, either enter the description for your products or if you want to import it from Akeneo, use the `&{values.description}` as a placeholder.
5. In the *Short description* field, either enter the short description for your products or if you want to import it from Akeneo, use the `&{values.short_description}` as a placeholder.
6. Optional: Define the tax set to use for the imported products. Do the following:
  1. Go to your project's Back Office, to **Administration -> Tax Sets** page.
  2. On the *Overview of tax sets* page, copy the value from the *Name* column of the tax set you want to use for the products imported from Akeneo PIM.
  3. Go back to the transformer creation page in the Spryker Middleware powered by Alumio and enter the tax name in the **Tax** field.
