You need to create a base in Alumio that you would use for communication between Spryker and Akeneo (incoming?) - Spryker http client.

In Alumio

To import data from Akeneo PIM to your Spryker project, you need to do the following:

1. Connect the Spryker Middleware Powered by Alumio with Akeneo PIM.
2. Connect SCCOS with the Middleware Powered by Alumio platform.
3. Configure data mapping between Akeneo and Spryker.
4. Run the import.

## Prerequisites

- To use the Akeneo PIM integration app, you need to buy the Spryker Middleware and the Akeneo PIM app. Contact the Spryker support team with your request.
- Make sure the Data Exchange API is installed with the minimum version 202307.0. [See Data Exchange API installation guide](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/202307.0/glue-api/dynamic-data-api/data-exchange-api-integration.html) for the installation instructions.


## 1. Connect the Spryker Middleware powered by Alumio with Akeneo PIM

{% info_block warningBox "Prerequisite" %}

Before you can connect the Spryker Middleware powered by Alumio with Akeneo, you must establish a connection in Akeneo for Spryker. The connection to Spryker must be with the *Data destination* flow type. For step-by-step instructions on how to set up the connection in Akeneo, refer to the [Akeneo documentation](https://help.akeneo.com/serenity-connect-your-pim/serenity-manage-your-connections).

![sccos-to-middleware-response]

## 3. Configure data mapping between Akeneo and Spryker

To configure data mapping between Akeneo and Spryker, you need to create an incoming and outgoing configuration.

### Create an incoming configuration

The incoming configuation defines what data should be retrieved from Akeneo and how this should be done.
To create an incoming configuration, do the following:

1. In the Spryker Middleware Powered by Alumio platform, go to **Connections->Incoming** and click the + sign.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the Name of your configuration. As you are entering the name, the identifier will be populated automatically based on the name.
3. Optional: In the **Description** field, add the description of your incoming configuration.
4. To activate the incoming configuration, set the status to *Enabled*.
5. In the *Subscriber* field, select *Akeneo Subscriber*. 
  QUESTION: What is the subscriber, what is each subscriber in the dropdown for, and how do they know which subscriber to select here?
6. In *Entity*, select the entity depending on what data you want to import from Akeneo. For example, to import product abstracts, select *Get list of products*.
7. Leave the *Input transformer* field empty.
8. In *HTTP Client*, select the Akeneo client that you created at this step: [Connect the Spryker Middleware powered by Alumio with Akeneo PIM](#1-connect-the-spryker-middleware-powered-by-alumio-with-akeneo-pim).
10. Live other fields empty. In the top right click **Save and continue**. You should see the message that the incomfing configuration has been created.
