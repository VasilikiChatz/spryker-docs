This document describes how to use the support portal to create and manage your cases.

## Prerequisites

You already have a customer login provisioned for you. If you do not have an account yet, request one using this form.
You can log in to the [support portal](https://support.spryker.com) by using the login button on the top right.

## Create new cases

To create new cases, you can use the **Create a case** drop-down menu and select the respective case type, or click on the case type on the landing page. When creating cases, make use of the recommendations explained in [Share secrets with the Spryker Support Team](/docs/about/all/support/share-secrets-with-the-spryker-support-team.html).

Spryker is using a Case Assistat that will guide you through the process of creating your requests. It will ask you for information where needed and makes sure your request is routed correctly. In the following we want to quickly explain the top level categories we currently have:

### Report a Problem or Incident

Problems can be reports suspecting a bug or issues with our hosting. Please make sure that you follow this guide to include everything we need to get working on your case right away. Where applicable it might suggest things you can try to resolve the problem yourself.

### Ask a Question
We primarily ask our customers and partners to use our community for questions around Spryker. We will provide you with a link to the documentation and [Spryker Community](https://commercequest.space/) here.

### Request help with Alumio
Here you can report problems with Alumio, request its provisioning for your environments, or schedule an appointment with Alumio Support.

### Infrstructure Change Request and Access Management
Here you can request all currently supported standard changes, such as requesting changes to non production sizing, IAM users and environment provisioning.

### Reporting a Problem with Spryker CI
This should be used if you have an issue with Spryker CI (Buddy), such as errors or issues with its UI or pipeline runs

### Announce a Go Live
When you are close to go live, you can announce it here. This will alert our Customer Success Team about your plans.

### Request Help with Spryker ACP
If you have an issue with the Spryker ACP connector, you can report it here.

### Request Professional Services
If you are struggling implementing custom features or want expert help or advice you will find here a selection of professional services we are offering.

### Request Help with Spryker Code Upgrader
If the Code Upgrader does not work as expected you can raise a case that will be routed to our Code Upgrader experts.

### Emergencies

Emergencies are reserved for problems that have significant business impact now or very soon. Emergency cases regularly start an [escalation](/docs/about/all/support/support-case-escalations.html). Please do not use this case type to simply try to speed up requests or problem reports. Emergencies need to be associated with significant risk or business impact, like revenue, security, or go-lives.

###  Info on Change Requests

{% info_block warningBox "Plan your change requests and use the right request form" %}

Due to verification processes and *role-based access control (RBAC)* mechanisms, change requests take some time to process. Allow 3-5 days of processing time.

Please note that only customers (through the support portal) can request new environments or access to environment monitoring. For contractual reasons, partners can't request these items.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Manage cases

Clicking on **Our Cases** brings you to a list view of all cases that you have opened with us. To take a look at the details of a particular case, click on the case number and it opens the detail page of that particular case. Here you can perform actions like asking for the revision of assigned priority, taking a look at the communication history, and viewing the current status of the case and any Jira Ticket that might be associated with the case.
