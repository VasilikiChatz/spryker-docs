The Merchant B2B Contracts & Contract Requests feature introduces initiation and management of relation requests, making it easier to connect both parties and to create buyer-merchant relations in B2B marketplaces and shops. These relations allow merchants and marketplace operators to specify buyer-specific products, prices, and order thresholds.
